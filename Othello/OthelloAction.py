class OthelloAction(object):
    """
      This class represents a 'move' in a game.
      The move is simply represented by two integers: the row and the column where the player puts the marker and a
      boolean to mark if it is a pass move or not.
      In addition, the OthelloAction has a field where the estimated value of the move can be stored during
      computations.
