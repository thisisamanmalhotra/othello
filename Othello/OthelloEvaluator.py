    This interface defines the mandatory methods for an evaluator, i.e., a class that can take a position and
    return an integer value that represents a heuristic evaluation of the position (positive numbers if the position is
    better for the first player, white). Notice that an evaluator is not supposed to make moves in the position to
    'see into the future', but only evaluate the static features of the postion.
